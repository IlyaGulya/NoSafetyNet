# NoSafetyNet
All you know that Xposed currently cannot bypass SafetyNet while being systemless.

The project aims to create fully-featured SafetyNet bypassing utility which uses Xposed API.

Why? Because not everyone wants this utility on their devices. 
While it is really useful for most users, it prevents experienced users to do a lot of useful stuff with their phones
by notifying applications about _cleanliness_ of our phones what leads to dysfunctionality of apps which uses SafetyNet Attestation API (like Google Pay, Samsung Pay, etc)
